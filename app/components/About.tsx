          I am a BSc Computer Science student with a solid background in Data Analysis, Deep Learning, and Node.js development, driven by a passion for research opportunities. I have experience working on projects involving cutting-edge web development frameworks and technologies. One project featured NextJS integrated with PostgreSQL, Tailwind UI, and React, creating a robust front-end and database solution. Another centered on backend development with NestJS, leveraging PostgreSQL for effective data handling. I studied Data Science for my major. Also, I am conducting an academic thesis focused on image segmentation.
